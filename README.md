# Zip-Bomb
be careful with this tech as the name is pretty explanitory but for those that it isn't here's what a zip bomb is.

A zip bomb is a compressed zip file that with holds a ton of storage and when uncompressed it quickly fills up the target devices storage making it run slow or make it unusable.

A popular option is 42.zip (im not writing a description for that cuz oml is it long)
